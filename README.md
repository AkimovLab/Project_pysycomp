This is experimental code for quantum mechanics, in order to be used for teaching purpose.

The Pysces library created uses Sympy and Matplotlib libraries as a backend. This library is still in progress.

Note that the "finalized" folder contains the latest code, but there is still a decent amount that needs to be refined within the code.

Topics include:

Commutators

Operators

Normalization (under progress)

Expectation Values (under progress)

Plotting Particle in a Box

Computing Laguerre, Laguerre Associated Polynomials

Computing Radial Solution for Given Quantum Numbers (under progress)

This code is created by Elizabeth Stippell, Lauryn Jerz under the guidance of Dr. Alexey Akimov at the University at Buffalo
