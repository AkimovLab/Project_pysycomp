# Pysces

This is experimental code for quantum mechanics, in order to be used for teaching purpose.

The Pysces library created uses Sympy and Matplotlib libraries as a backend. This library is still in progress.

Note that the "finalized" folder contains foundations of quantum mechanics such as:

Commutators

Operators

Normalization 

Expectation Values

Plotting Particle in a Box

Computing Laguerre, Laguerre Associated Polynomials

Some of the other areas of interest are:

Spherical Harmonics, Harmonic Oscillators, Anharmonic Oscillators, Perturbation Theory

Ladder Operators

Some areas of higher level research for implementing the code can be found in the following files, and are not intended for teaching purposes:

heisenberg_EOM    (Heisenberg Equation of Motion - in progress)

gaussian_wavepackets (Gaussian Wave Packets - in progress)
