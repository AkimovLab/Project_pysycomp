This is experimental code for quantum mechanics, in order to be used for teaching purpose.

Note that there is no specific library created, as that is a work in progress to ensure the functions are able to operate.

Topics include:

Commutators

Operators

Normalization (under progress)

Expectation Values (under progress)

Plotting Particle in a Box

Computing Laguerre, Laguerre Associated Polynomials

Computing Radial Solution for Given Quantum Numbers (under progress)

This code is created by Elizabeth Stippell, Lauryn Jerz under the guidance of Dr. Alexey Akimov at the University at Buffalo
